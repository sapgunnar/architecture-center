2 components have been developed for the Architecture Center:

- **The Contributors component**: This section displays a list of contributors in an admonition at the bottom of the main page of the reference architecture, acknowledging their efforts and input.

- **The draw.io component**: This section features an admonition for a Draw.io file located in the architecture section of the page. Users can either download the file for offline use or create an online copy to edit directly. You can define a specific title for your draw.io file. By Default, the page title will be used.

## Contributors declaration in the header of the `readme.md` file (front matter)

```yaml
# CONTRIBUTORS: GitHub username(s) of the main contributor(s)
contributors:
  - cernus76
  - jmsrpp
  - navyakhurana
```

## Calling the draw.io component in the page body of the `readme.md` file

```yaml
![drawio](drawio/demo.drawio)
```

Or

```yaml
![drawio](drawio/demo.drawio "My title goes there")
```
Note: Use the markdown image syntax for drawio files.
