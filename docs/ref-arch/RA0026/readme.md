**Embodied AI** combines artificial intelligence with a physical form — such as robots — that can perceive and act in the real world.
**Embodied AI Agents** take the next step: extending the impact of [SAP Business AI](https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html) into physical operations by [combining business-aware AI agents with robots for autonomous task execution](https://news.sap.com/tags/embodied-ai/).
This empowers organizations to adapt more quickly to dynamic operational environments.

:::tip Physical AI vs. Embodied AI vs. Embedded AI
**Physical AI** refers to all forms of artificial intelligence focused on the physical world, including specialized models for perception, navigation, manipulation, and more. [**Embodied AI**](https://news.sap.com/tags/embodied-ai/) leverages physical AI combined with AI agents. [**Embedded AI**](https://www.sap.com/resources/embedded-ai-explained) focuses on digital systems, enabling smarter decisions inside business applications.
:::

## Key Capabilities

Embodied AI enables end-to-end automation of tasks across the physical and digital world.
SAP embeds Embodied AI into the business process, unlike standalone automation approaches, seamlessly incorporating this technology with enterprise software systems.
Embodied AI is one of SAP's [six disruptions](https://www.asug.com/insights/six-disruptions-to-guide-the-next-generation-of-enterprise-software) that will transform how industries operate.

Embodied AI Agents can be equipped to perform tasks such as:

- Sense and interpret physical environment in real time
- Adapt dynamically to errors, delays, or environmental changes
- Act autonomously in accordance with business priorities and operational constraints

This results in business benefits including decreased manual effort, increased human safety, and increased adaptability to changing demands.

## Foundational Building Blocks

These building blocks form the foundation of Embodied AI:

1. **Native Integration into SAP**: this brings business context, data, and processes into physical execution while also ensuring that connected systems are kept updated with the latest real world observations.
2. **Agentic AI**: agentic reasoning and decision-making capabilities can handle the complex, unpredictable nature of the physical world.
3. **Cognitive Robots**: robotics hardware advances across diverse forms, such as quadrupeds, wheeled humanoids, and humanoids, are increasingly capable to do the full motion of physical tasks required in industry.
4. **Physical AI Models**: this includes **vision-language models** (VLMs), **vision-language-action models** (VLAs), **robotic world models**, and **robotics foundation models** (RFMs); **vertical training** refers to the process of teaching models how to perform specialized tasks in specific bodies, which can be used to customize for customer-specific tasks.

:::tip What Robots Does SAP Support?
Embodied AI at SAP is **vendor agnostic**, including robots of all forms.
Since [SAP first announced exploring physical AI in 2025](https://news.sap.com/2025/06/neura-robotics-sap-nvidia-future-of-physical-ai/), it has been [expanding its partner ecosystem](https://news.sap.com/2025/11/sap-physical-ai-partnerships-new-robotics-pilots/).

## Use Cases

Embodied AI is well-suited for tasks involving some degree of **unpredictability**.
This unpredictability can be in the task itself or in the task environment.
A use case can correspond to one or multiple SAP applications.
The following table shows typical use cases across supply chain, logistics, and manufacturing.

| Use Case                    | Associated SAP Software |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| **Warehouse Pick & Place** ([ref](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/docs/ref-arch/083f2d968e/2)) | [SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/extended-warehouse-management.html), [SAP Logistics Management (LGM)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/logistics-management.html) |
| **Asset Inspection** ([ref](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/docs/ref-arch/083f2d968e/3)) | [SAP Asset Performance Management (APM)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/apm.html), [SAP Field Service Management (FSM)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/field-service-management.html) |
| **Health & Safety Inspection** ([ref](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/docs/ref-arch/083f2d968e/4)) | [SAP S/4HANA for EHS workplace safety (EHS)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/safety-management-software.html) |
| **Quality Inspection** ([ref](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/docs/ref-arch/083f2d968e/5)) | [SAP S/4HANA Manufacturing for planning and scheduling (S/4 PP)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/manufacturing-for-planning-and-scheduling.html) |
| **Material Handling & Assembly**  | [SAP Digital Manufacturing (DM)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/digital-manufacturing.html) |

Further use case areas include in retail and service environments.
An advantage of native SAP integration is that Embodied AI Agents can multi-task, for example reporting safety incidents via [SAP EHS](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/safety-management-software.html) while doing a warehouse operations task from [SAP EWM](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/extended-warehouse-management.html).


:::info
Embodied AI does **not** replace traditional robotics and manufacturing automation such as Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), which are a good fit for predictable, repetitive tasks.
Instead, it complements these to be able to automate what was "not-automatable" and achieve end-to-end autonomous enterprise.
