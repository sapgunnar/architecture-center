## Architecture

![drawio](drawio/reference-architecture-safety.drawio)

## Key Components

### Safety-Related Software

Health and safety related "missions" and "tasks" for robots are derived from compliance regulations, safety checklists, and other such processes.
The relevant SAP application for health and safety is [SAP S/4HANA for EHS workplace safety (EHS)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/safety-management-software.html).

Observations during the safety inspection and inspection results can also be stored accordingly, for human reference and for further use by other digital agents.

Note that it's not only about a source system for tasks - these applications also contain valuable context, guardrails, and other capabilities that can be applied during the inspection.
