To enable compliant and secure integration with hyperscaler services, SAP recommends using federated identity mechanisms instead of long-lived credentials. By leveraging standards such as OIDC and X.509 certificate-based authentication, SAP BTP workloads can access services on hyperscaler with traceable, short-lived credentials that align with enterprise security and audit requirements.

The following reference architectures illustrate how federated authentication can be implemented for corresponding hyperscaler.

## Architecture

<Tabs
  defaultValue="aws"
  values={[
    {label: 'Amazon Web Services', value: 'aws'},
    {label: 'Google Cloud Platform', value: 'gcp'}
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="aws">
    ![drawio](drawio/oidc-sts.drawio)
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="gcp">
    ![drawio](drawio/gcp-oidc.drawio)
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Flow

1. **Identity Federation**: SAP IAS or certificate authority is registered with the hyperscaler as a trusted source.
2. **Token or Certificate Exchange**: The workload presents a signed token or client certificate to the hyperscaler.
3. **Temporary Credential Issuance**: Based on the verified identity, short-lived credentials are issued to assume a scoped role or service account.
4. **Resource Access**: The workload uses these credentials to access cloud-native services securely, with full auditability and revocability.

## Characteristics


| Characteristic               | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No long-lived secrets       | Uses short-lived tokens or signed certificates instead of static credentials. |
| Strong isolation            | Each workload is assigned a scoped identity and tightly controlled role.    |
| Seamless credential flow    | Eliminates manual secret rotation; credentials are derived dynamically.     |
