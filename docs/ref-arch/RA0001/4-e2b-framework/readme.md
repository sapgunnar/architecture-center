One of the EDA use cases is around SAP BTP extension applications consuming the events from SAP systems or third-party systems and triggering business actions in SAP systems. This reference architecture provides a custom application framework based on SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) to build event-driven applications in SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) which can consume events from different source systems and trigger business actions in SAP systems.

This is a sample reference application which can be extended and customized to build event-based integration scenarios from different systems/applications into the SAP ecosystem using SAP BTP. 

Note: This is not SAP standard product or service offering. This is a custom developed framework based on SAP CAP to build event-driven applications in SAP BTP.

Evaluate SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh offerings and if additional custom management of events are required, this approach can be evaluated and implemented. This framework can be integrated with SAP Integration Suite,advanced event mesh or Event Mesh capability of SAP Integration Suite.
 
## Architecture

![drawio](drawio/e2b-cc.drawio)

This architecture can be leveraged to build event-based integration scenarios from different systems/applications (providers) into the SAP ecosystem (consumers) using SAP BTP. This uses asynchronous communication via message broker.
This features a CAP-based application framework (Events-To-Business Actions Framework) which allows you to configure set of actions for a particular business scenario. Based on the events category and type, respective actions are triggered in SAP Line of Business (LoB) applications. It also uses SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh / Event Mesh capability in SAP Integration Suite, SAP Build Process Automation, SAP HANA Cloud, SAP Destination Service, SAP Connectivity service with cloud connector. 

An alternative architecture can be considered with SAP Private Link service for integrating SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA in scenarios where both SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA run on the same Hyperscaler environment (Microsoft Azure or AWS).
The reference applications with Microsoft Azure and AWS demonstrates and helps to build end-to-end event-based integration scenario.


## Architecture Components

Learn about the roles and interactions of the key services and components in the Reference Architecture to understand how the different services are leveraged to achieve real-time event integration scenarios.

### SAP Integration Suite for Event Broker

For asynchronous communication, the EDA solution offerings from SAP are SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh and SAP Integration Suite, event mesh capability. EDA enables clean core strategy by leveraging the data from all applications to build extension applications on SAP BTP.

Advanced event mesh is a distributed multi-broker event mesh designed to manage and monitor events across enterprise landscapes, including SAP and third-party applications, services, and technologies. It provides centralized visibility and control, distributed event processing, and flexible deployments, making it essential for large businesses.

The Event Mesh capability of SAP Integration Suite (“Event Mesh capability” for short) is an event broker which will enable implementation of starter or small volume EDA scenarios across SAP and third-party applications.

As per [SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology (ISA-M)](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-guidance-framework/sap-integration-solution-advisory-methodology/catalog-of-integration-use-case-patterns),either of the options can be selected based on the eventing requirements. 

### SAP CAP for Extension Application

The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It supports Java (with Spring Boot), JavaScript, and TypeScript (with Node.js), which are some of the most widely adopted languages. CAP is recommended by the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/btp-developers-guide), and supports developers with a path of proven best practices and a wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.

#### Events-To-Business Actions Framework based on SAP CAP
In this reference architecture, the events-to-business actions framework is developed as CAP application using Node.js. This serves as the central component and a reusable component. Below are the key characteristics and benefits of using the framework.

- Provides comprehensive programming and configuration model for development of event-based integration scenario with SAP systems.
- Flexible and generic framework that can be easily extended for any Line of Business (LoB) scenario, workflow, or process, and any source system events.
- Integrates with fully-managed cloud services for enabling application to communicate asynchronously through events.
- Supports seamless integration for automation/workflow/business rules requirements.
- Provides recommendations for chain of actions that needs to be executed for the subscribed events using Generative AI.

### SAP HANA Cloud for Application Data

SAP HANA Cloud offers a comprehensive platform combining advanced data management with AI-enhanced applications, each serving distinct but complementary roles in fostering sophisticated and intelligent business solutions.

The Vector Engine in SAP HANA Cloud manages unstructured data, such as text and images, in high-dimensional embedding, enhancing AI models with long-term memory and better context. These features enable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), combining LLMs with private business data to create intelligent applications that support automated decision-making and boost developer productivity. For the Generative AI assisted configuration, the vector engine capabilities can be leveraged.

### Private Link Service for secure connectivity

SAP Private Link service is a feature offered by cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows customers to expose their services in their virtual networks to consumers in other virtual networks or subscriptions. In this architecture, SAP Private Link service allows to securely connect applications running on SAP BTP to SAP workloads running on Hyperscalers(Microsoft Azure or AWS).

## Flow of events in this architecture

Pre-requisites to be configured:
- Extension application based on event-to-business actions framework has to be deployed in SAP Cloud Foundry Runtime.
- Configurations for SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh, SAP HANA Cloud, SAP Destination Service, SAP Private Link Service/Cloud Connector, Generative AI Hub(optional).
- User with Application Admin role should log into the SAP BTP extension application to configure the business rules/decisions and the business actions that need to be triggered in the business systems.

The following depicts the flow of events in a typical event based business scenario.

1. The events are triggered from source systems like Microsoft Azure, AWS, or Telco IoT Platforms (in the case of IoT scenarios).
2. These events are published on to SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh / SAP Event Mesh. As the processor module's (part of the Events-to-Business-Action framework) endpoint subscribes to Event Mesh, the event is received.
3. The processor module, part of the Events-to-Business-Action framework, leverages the **Decisions** capability of SAP Build Process Automation to initiate business actions. For example, Purchase Order Requisition creation in the SAP S/4HANA system based on characteristics of incoming events.
4. The defined action is triggered in the SAP S/4HANA system using the SAP Destination Service and SAP Connectivity service leveraging a cloud connector setup. If SAP S/4HANA and SAP BTP are running on the same Hyperscaler, communication with SAP S/4HANA happens via the SAP Private Link Service.
