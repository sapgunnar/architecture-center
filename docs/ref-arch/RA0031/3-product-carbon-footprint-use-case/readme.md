Tracking the carbon footprint of a product across complex supply chains requires multiple companies to exchange emissions data — a process that demands both data integrity and verified identity. SAP Decentralized Identity Verification (DIV) enables this by providing a **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) infrastructure** where supply chain partners can prove their identity and their membership in a trust network using **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**, without relying on a central authority.

This reference architecture illustrates how a **Gearbox Supplier** and a **Car Manufacturer** use the **Bring Your Own Wallet (BYOW)** provisioning model to each operate their own DIV instance on SAP BTP, and then exchange Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) data securely. In the BYOW model, each company self-provisions their DIV wallet independently — the **Operator** (e.g., Cofinity-X) retains its role as the trusted issuer of the membership credential, but the wallet infrastructure is owned and operated by each member.

## Architecture

![drawio](drawio/product-carbon-footprint-use-case.drawio "Product Carbon Footprint Use Case")

The architecture involves three parties, each owning their own wallet infrastructure:

- **Operator** — the dataspace operator (e.g., Cofinity-X) who verifies member identities and issues membership credentials to the members' own wallets.
- **Gearbox Supplier** — a tier-1 supplier who has provisioned their **own DIV wallet** on SAP BTP. The wallet holds the membership VC issued by the Operator and a company DID anchored on the DID network.
- **Car Manufacturer** — an OEM who has provisioned their **own DIV wallet** on SAP BTP. The wallet holds the membership VC issued by the Operator and a company DID anchored on the DID network.

DIV's Agent on each side communicates using the **IATP (Interoperability and Trust Protocol)** to exchange and verify membership credentials before PCF data is transferred via the **Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC)**.
