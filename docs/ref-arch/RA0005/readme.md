Harness the power of Generative AI (GenAI) in your applications on SAP BTP, providing a robust framework for optimizing AI-driven application development and data management.

For applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) aiming to harness the power of Generative AI, this Reference Architecture provides a comprehensive framework.
At its core, this reference architecture features a [CAP](#sap-cloud-application-programming-model)-based backend to manage application logic,
SAP HANA Cloud for storing data, including embeddings to facilitate similarity search with the power of its [Vector Engine](#vector-engine),
and the [Generative AI Hub](#generative-ai-hub) as the central access point to Foundation Models and Large Language Models (LLMs).
It demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate various LLMs using the Generative AI Hub in SAP AI Core, maximizing the potential of different Frameworks, Plugins, and SDKs in CAP. This enables the implementation of advanced patterns, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with embeddings, to further enhance the solution's effectiveness. This architecture accommodates both Cloud Foundry and Kyma runtimes, ensuring adaptability in leveraging GenAI within SAP BTP applications.

## Architecture

![drawio](./drawio/reference-architecture-generative-ai.drawio)

Learn about the roles and interactions of the key services and components in the Reference Architecture to understand how they support the efficient use of Generative AI:

### SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

The [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications.
It supports Java (with Spring Boot), JavaScript, and TypeScript (with Node.js), which are some of the most widely adopted languages.
CAP is recommended by the [SAP BTP Developer's Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/), and supports developers with a path of proven best practices and a wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.

In the provided Reference Architecture, CAP serves as the central hub for application and domain logic, interacting with SAP solutions (Cloud or On-Premise), 3rd party applications, and managing data sources such as SAP HANA Cloud. Within the application logic, various plugins (e.g., [CAP LLM Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cap-llm-plugin)) and SDKs like SAP Cloud SDK for AI ([JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-js) or [Java](https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-java)) can be utilized to support the development of Generative AI solutions - also together with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).

### Generative AI Hub

The [Generative AI Hub](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/generative-ai-hub-in-sap-ai-core) incorporates Generative AI into your AI activities in [SAP AI Core](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-ai-core?region=all) and [SAP AI Launchpad](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-ai-launchpad?region=all).

To achieve this, the Generative AI Hub offers secure and reliable access to Foundation Models, primarily Large Language Models (LLMs), hosted on SAP BTP or by external partners such as Microsoft Azure, Google, and AWS, but also simplifies their integration into business processes. These models can be used for different domain-specific applications, utilizing patterns like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), AI Agents, or Conversational AI, all accessed via standardized APIs to streamline the implementation of Generative AI. Also, see Additional Concepts like a [Prompt Registry](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/prompt-registry) to manage prompt lifecycles or [Prompt Optimization](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/prompt-optimization) to refine prompts against target datasets, improving end-to-end model performance.

An important feature of the Generative AI Hub is [Orchestration](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/orchestration), which combines content generation via an [Harmonized API](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/harmonized-api) with essential functions often required in business AI scenarios. These functions include:

-   **Gounding**: Allows to integrate external, contextually relevant, domain-specific, or real-time data into AI processes. This data supplements the natural language processing capabilities of pre-trained models, which are trained on general material.
-   **Templating**: Allows you to compose prompts with placeholders filled during inference.
-   **Translation**: Allows you to translate LLM text prompts into a chosen target language.
-   **Data Masking**: Provides anonymization or pseudonymization of data before it's processed by a generative AI model. In cases of pseudonymization, masked data appearing in the model's
-   **Content Filtering**: Enables restriction of the type of content passed to and from a generative AI model.response will be unmasked.

In a basic orchestration scenario, different modules from orchestration can be combined into a pipeline and executed with a single API call. Within this pipeline, the response from one module is used as the input for the next module. The order of execution within the pipeline is centrally defined in orchestration. However, details for each module can be configured, and optional modules can be omitted by including an orchestration configuration in JSON format with the request body or even easier leveraging the [SAP Cloud SDK for AI](https://sap.github.io/ai-sdk/).
