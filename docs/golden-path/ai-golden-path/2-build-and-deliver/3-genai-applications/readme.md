## Build

This code sample [GenAI Mail Insights - Develop a CAP-based application using GenAI and RAG on SAP BTP](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-genai-rag) presents an application on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). This scenario presents a comprehensive solution for enhancing customer support within a travel agency, utilizing advanced email insights and automation. The system analyzes incoming emails using Large Language Models (LLMs) to offer core insights such as categorization, sentiment analysis and urgency assessment. It goes beyond basic analysis by extracting key facts and customizable fields like location, managed through a dedicated configuration page. Additionally, another [project](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-genai-semantic-search) is a basic sample for a semantic search engine built on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). It uses the Cloud Application Programming (CAP) model and integrates Generative AI Hub and SAP HANA Cloud’s Vector Engine to offer scalable and powerful search capabilities on any kind of text data like product or material descriptions.

Some of the key steps in the development process:

### 1. Project Setup
Initialize a new project using CAP framework and then expand it to a full-stack application if you want a complete end-to-end application including [approuter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/approuter). Prepare and subscribe to all the necessary services on SAP BTP. This [estimator](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/estimator/?commercialModel=btpea) helps in sizing and estimating the costs incurred for the necessary BTP services. 

### 2. Access to Generative AI models
Once the SAP AI Core service with Extended plan is setup, different models are available for consumption individually or via orchestration.  Orchestration in SAP AI Core is a managed service that enables unified access, control, and execution of generative AI models through standardized APIs. Refer to [SAP Note 3437766](https://me.sap.com/notes/3437766) for an up-to-date overview of available models and their versions. There is also an [estimator](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-estimator-v1) available which helps in estimating the costs incurred for the necessary AI services. On top of this, there is also [SAP Document AI](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/sap-document-ai?region=all) available on SAP BTP if there is a necessity to process documents in the scope of your application.

### 3. Prompting
Prompt engineering is a critical step in building reliable LLM-powered applications. It involves designing clear and structured prompts that guide the model to produce accurate, consistent, and business-relevant outputs. This includes defining system and user prompts, controlling parameters such as temperature and token limits, and enforcing structured responses (e.g., JSON schemas) when integrating outputs into downstream systems.

### 4. Integration with SAP Systems
This typically involves connecting to systems such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors, or other SAP solutions via secure APIs (e.g., OData or REST services), leveraging destinations configured in SAP BTP.

### 5. Logging & Observability
Logging and observability are critical to operating LLM-powered applications reliably in production. All interactions with generative models—including prompts, responses, token usage, response times, and error messages—should be logged in a controlled and secure manner. This enables traceability, troubleshooting, and auditability, while ensuring that sensitive data is handled according to enterprise compliance policies through masking or filtering.

## Deploy

Deploying the application to SAP BTP involves packaging and releasing the solution into the target runtime environment, such as Cloud Foundry through Multi-Target Application (MTA) model. This includes binding the application to required services like SAP AI Core, SAP HANA Cloud, and SAP Cloud Identity Services, as well as configuring environment variables and service credentials securely. A structured deployment strategy should define separate landscapes (e.g., Development, Test, Production) to ensure controlled releases and proper validation before going live. [CI/CD](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/continuous-integration-and-delivery-ci-cd) pipelines can automate build, test, and deployment steps, enabling consistent release of the application. 

## Run

In the Run phase of an SAP BTP application consuming SAP AI Core and the Generative AI Hub, particular attention must be given to model depreciation and operational stability. [Prompt registry](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/generative-ai/prompt-registry) described in the best practices section below will thoroughly help you in this regard. Teams should continuously monitor model availability, version updates, and deprecation notices to ensure that production applications are not impacted by retired or upgraded foundation models. A clear versioning and fallback strategy—combined with regression testing when switching model versions—helps maintain consistent output quality.

## Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Use Joule Studio to build a custom skill when your use case is designed to be accessed purely as a conversational interface | Design user interfaces to function purely for conversation |
| Use Prompt Registry to manage prompts  | Hardcode your prompts |
| Use the SAP AI SDK for LLM interactions | Build custom LLM integrations from scratch |
| Follow the MTA deployment model | Deploy without proper CI/CD pipelines |
| Implement proper tracing and metering | Ignore cross-cutting concerns |
